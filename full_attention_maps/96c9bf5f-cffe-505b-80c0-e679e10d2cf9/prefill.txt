Example 6 The rules of a "level-up game" stipulate: On the $n$-th level, a die must be rolled $n$ times. If the sum of the points obtained from these $n$ rolls is greater than $2^{n}$, the level is considered passed. Questions:
(1) What is the maximum number of levels a person can pass in this game?
(2) What is the probability that he can pass the first three levels consecutively?
(Note: A die is a uniform cube with points numbered $1,2,3,4,5,6$ on its faces. The number of points on the face that lands up after rolling the die is the result of the roll.)Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within oxed{}.Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.To solve this problem, we need to address two main questions:

1. Determine the maximum number of levels a person can pass in this game.
2. Calculate the probability that a person can pass the first three levels consecutively.

### Part 1: Maximum Number of Levels

First, we need to understand the rules of the game. On the \(n\)-th level, a die is rolled \(n\) times, and the sum of the points must be greater than \(2^n\) to pass the level.

A standard die has faces numbered from 1 to 6. Therefore, the minimum sum for \(n\) rolls is \(n \times 1 = n\), and the maximum sum is \(n \times 6 = 6n\).

We need to find the largest \(n\) such that the maximum possible sum \(6n\) is greater than \(2^n\). This will give us the highest level that can possibly be passed.

Let's compute \(6n\) and \(2^n\) for successive values of \(n\):

- For \(n = 1\):
  \[
  6 \times 1 = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad 2^1 = 2 \quad \rightarrow \quad 6 > 2 \quad \text{(passable)}
  \]

- For \(n = 2\):
  \[
  6 \times 2 = 12 \quad \text{and} \quad 2^2 = 4 \quad \rightarrow \quad 12 > 4 \quad \text{(passable)}
  \]

- For \(n = 3\):
  \[
  6 \times 3 = 18 \quad \text{and} \quad 2^3 = 8 \quad \rightarrow \quad 18 > 8 \quad \text{(passable)}
  \]

- For \(n = 4\):
  \[
  6 \times 4 = 24 \quad \text{and} \quad 2^4 = 16 \quad \rightarrow \quad 24 > 16 \quad \text{(passable)}
  \]

- For \(n = 5\):
  \[
  6 \times 5 = 30 \quad \text{and} \quad 2^5 = 32 \quad \rightarrow \quad 30 < 32 \quad \text{(not passable)}
  \]

So, for \(n = 5\), the maximum possible sum is less than \(2^n\), meaning it's impossible to pass the 5th level. Therefore, the maximum number of levels a person can pass is 4.

### Part 2: Probability of Passing the First Three Levels Consecutively

Next, we need to calculate the probability that a person can pass the first three levels consecutively. This means passing levels 1, 2, and 3 in sequence.

Since each level's rolls are independent, the overall probability is the product of the probabilities of passing each individual level.

#### Level 1:

- Roll 1 die, sum > \(2^1 = 2\).
- Possible sums: 1 or 2.
- Sum > 2 means sum must be 3, 4, 5, or 6.

Wait, actually, sum > 2 means sum >= 3.

Possible sums:

- Sum = 1: 1 way (1)
- Sum = 2: 1 way (2)

Total possible outcomes: 6.

Favorable outcomes: sum > 2, which is sums 3 to 6.

Number of favorable outcomes: 6 - 2 = 4.

Probability for level 1: \(\frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}\).

#### Level 2:

- Roll 2 dice, sum > \(2^2 = 4\).
- Possible sums range from 2 to 12.
- Sum > 4 means sum >= 5.

We need to find the probability that the sum of two dice is at least 5.

First, find the total number of outcomes: \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

Now, find the number of outcomes where sum < 5, i.e., sums 2, 3, or 4.

- Sum = 2: (1,1) → 1 way
- Sum = 3: (1,2), (2,1) → 2 ways
- Sum = 4: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1) → 3 ways

Total unfavorable outcomes: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

Therefore, favorable outcomes: 36 - 6 = 30.
